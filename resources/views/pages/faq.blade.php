<h3>HuffPost Community Code of Conduct</h3>
<br>
<p>Welcome to the HuffPost Community: HuffPost promotes a receptive, transparent and civil atmosphere for comments and users.</p>
<p> We are dedicated to maintaining a respectful community that actively engages in lively discussions about stories in the news. Please keep the following in mind when writing comments:</p>

<p>Respect Others: Be polite to all the members of our community, including other commenters, authors, and the subjects of articles. Real people read your comments. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to voice their opinion, regardless of identity, politics, ideology, religion or agreement with other community members, the author of the post or staff members, as long as those opinions are respectful and constructively add to the conversation. HuffPost does not tolerate direct or indirect attacks, name-calling or insults, nor does it tolerate intentional attempts to derail, hijack, troll or bait others. We reserve the right to remove such comments whenever warranted. Individuals who consistently or intentionally post these types of comments may lose their ability to comment and, if necessary, may be permanently excluded from the platform. </p>

<p>Safe Space: Above all, we strongly believe that the HuffPost community should be a safe and welcoming space for all individuals, groups and their ideas. Using purposefully insulting or hostile language and making personal threats are not welcome. If you directly or indirectly threaten the physical or mental well-being of a member of this community, or an individual or group, you may be removed immediately. If a credible threat is made against an individual or group, it may also be reported to law enforcement, and we will cooperate with them. Personally identifiable information should never be posted to HuffPost comments sections, for the privacy and protection of all community members. This includes but is not limited to full names, addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses. Any comments that contain such information will be deleted. (Personally identifiable information excludes your displayed name as it appears on HuffPost comments; HuffPost highly discourages anonymous usernames and pseudonyms)</p>

<p>Moderation: In order to provide this space, comments are pre-moderated by our content filters before they are posted to a story’s comments thread. Please note that comments that include links to other websites, or embedded images and videos, are not permitted in our comment threads. This is to protect against the possibility of abuse and malware that can come from unrecognized links or media.</p>

<p>Be yourself, only yourself, and just one of yourself.: Every person's opinion is valuable and unique. Pretending to be someone else removes that value. Don't misrepresent yourself or others, or spread misinformation. If you do, you make the community less enjoyable and valuable. Misrepresentation will be removed whenever it's found.</p>

<h3>Questions about commenting & policies</h3>
<br>
<h4>Q: Do I need a HuffPost account to comment?</h4>
<br>
<p>- A: No, but you need a Facebook or Twitter account to sign in to the commenting platform,
     which is operated by our third party comment partner (spot.im). </p>
<br>
 

<h4>Q: What does it mean to comment on a HuffPost article?</h4>
<br>

     The spot.im comments plugin is loaded whenever you open the comment thread on a story.
      People with slower connections may have trouble loading comments on a story with high volume.
       Please try reloading the page or switching to a faster connection if you are having problems.</p>

       <br>

<h4>Q: I posted a comment. Why can't I see it on the site?</h4>
<br>
<p>- A: Be aware that not all comments will appear immediately on the site, particularly if they contain filtered words, links or media flagged by our moderation tools. If this happens, you may need to rephrase your comment (removing profanity, links, or media) and submit it again.</p>
<br>
 

<h4>Q: Why do my posts never appear in HuffPost comments?</h4>
<br>
<p>- A: If a user has repeatedly posted comments that violate any of these ground rules, their comments may be blocked from appearing on the site. This includes inappropriate comments that contain, insults, attacks, abuse towards other users or groups.</p>
<br>
 

<h4>Q: Why am I being asked to consent to a cookie policy? What is this?</h4>
<br>
