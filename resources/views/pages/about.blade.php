<p>BlogLand is the original internet newspaper, founded in 2005. Now we have newsrooms and editions in 15 countries. We’re truly global, but still feel local. In the UK we do relevant breaking news, powerful original journalism, and we report on the real lives of our readers. We tell stories in text, video, audio and pictures, and bring them to our audiences wherever they are. 
        We're fast, fun and inclusive. And we'll always make sure you know what's real.</p> 
<br>
      <p>  At BlogLand UK, we: </p>
        <ul>
             <li> Ask the questions our readers want asked </li>
                <li> Expose bad things and shout “gotcha” </li>
                        <li> But we are kinder: report good things and solutions when we find them </li>
                                <li> Get outside the bubble </li>
                                        <li> Humanise the story </li>
                                                <li> Are accessible: explain, explain, explain </li>
                                                        <li> Are real: avoid formulas and grasp the counterintuitive </li>
                                                                <li> Are unapologetically entertaining </li>

        <h4> OUR COMMITMENT TO INCLUSIVITY </h4>
        <br>
      <p>  We believe diversity – in who we are, how we tell our stories, and among the people we write for – is critical to our mission.
        We aim to write for, and not just about, those left out of traditional power structures; to approach stories inclusively; and to serve a diverse audience with stories that matter to them.
         This means including a diverse range of voices in our reporting,
          actively pursuing diversity in our newsroom, and listening to our readers and viewers to make sure we're as open
           and responsive as possible. </p>
           <br>
        <h4>  STANDARDS </h4>
        <br>
       <p> We endeavour to be accurate in its reporting, transparent and thorough in its sourcing, and fair and independent in its analysis. BlogLand strives to verify and corroborate information via multiple sources whenever possible. BlogLand grants anonymity to sources so they can provide information in the public interest without putting themselves at risk; BlogLand does not grant anonymity to sources so they can avoid accountability for their opinions. All reporters are trained to follow our internal editorial code.</p>
       <br>
        <h4> CORRECTIONS </h4>
        <br>
        <p> BlogLand UK works to correct any misstatements in a timely manner, with a correction note appended to the bottom of an article to indicate what has been fixed and how. More prominent notices may be included for more egregious errors. We will only retract an article after extensive review by a senior editor has found fundamental flaws in the reporting, and always with an editor's note.</p>
        <br>
       <p> If you think you’ve spotted an error, we would be really grateful if you could let us know. On any BlogLand UK article page, you will find a link to “Suggest a correction”. Hit that link and you can alert us to the issue. We will endeavour to get back to you as quickly as possible. Alternatively email uk-corrections@BlogLand.com </p>
